// The four rules defined in the constants below achieve the following purposes:
// - Redirect traffic to the target application through the proxy, excluding traffic from the proxy itself.
// - Reset existing, non-redirected connections to the target application, except those of the proxy itself.
// Excluding traffic from the proxy from the goals above is not entirely straightforward, mainly because the proxy,
// just like `kubectl port-forward` and sidecars, connect _from_ the loopback address 127.0.0.1.
//
// To achieve this, we take advantage of the fact that the proxy knows the pod IP and connects to it, instead of to the
// loopback address like sidecars and kubectl port-forward does. This allows us to distinguish the proxy traffic from
// port-forwarded traffic, as while both traverse the `lo` interface, the former targets the pod IP while the latter
// targets the loopback IP.
