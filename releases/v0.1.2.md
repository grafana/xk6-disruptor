This is a patch release that fixes a few bugs and does minor improvements.

## Improvements
- [Prevent execution of multiple concurrent fault injections into the same targets](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor/issues/87). This situation would lead to unexpected results. This is particularly important to avoid situation as those described in https://github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor/issues/82
- [Parameter validation in all API methods](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor/issues/93). Check for parameter types and also detect malformed objects in JS (see for example https://github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor/issues/41).
